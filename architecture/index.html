        <ul>
            <li>Key Concerns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reusability</li>
                    <li>Single perpuse & avoidence of dependencies on other elements</li>
                    <li>If specific parts of your application fail, can it still function?</li>
                    <li>How easily can you test individual modules</li>
                    <li>Decouple View from Model and from Controls - so you can change them in the future </li>
                    <li>Use setters for the model (to prevent unsuprvised changes to the store), and have a log, to
                        understan how changed the model </li>
                    <li>
                        "The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into
                        small pieces. Then, assemble
                        those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application" -

                    <li>
                        "The key is to acknowledge from the start that you have no idea how this will grow. When you
                        accept that you don't know
                        everything, you begin to design the system defensively. You identify the key areas that may
                        change, which often is very
                        easy when you put a little bit of time into it. For instance, you should expect that any part
                        of the app that
                        communicates with another system will likely change, so you need to abstract that away." -

        <h2>The Proposed Architecture</h2>

        <p>The solution to the architecture we seek to define is a combination of three well-known design patterns: the
            <b>module</b>,
            <b>facade</b> and <b>mediator</b>.</p>
        <p>Rather than the traditional model of modules directly communicating with each other, in this decoupled
            architecture,
            they'll instead only publish events of interest (ideally, without a knowledge of other modules in the
            system). The
            mediator pattern will be used to both subscribe to messages from these modules and handle what the
            appropriate
            response to notifications should be. The facade pattern will be used to enforce module permissions.</p>

        <p>I will be going into more detail on each of these patterns below:</p>
